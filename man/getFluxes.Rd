  # Write your example here. You can also add more Start..End blocks if needed.
  # Please mask all output such as print() with the special tag
  #    
  # such that the test is not littered. Statements guarded by  are enabled
  # in the example file which is extracted from this test file. To extract the
  # example run
  #    extractExamples()
  # on the R command line.
    
    ## Generate another equation list

    eq <- addReaction(eq, "B", "pB", "act_B * B * pA_pA", "Phosphorylation of B")
    eq <- addReaction(eq, "pB", "B", "deact_B * pB", "Deposphorylation of pB")
    
    ## Extract data.frame of reactions
    reactions <- getReactions(eq)

    ## Get conserved quantities
    cq <- conservedQuantities(eq$smatrix)

    ## Get fluxes
    fluxes <- getFluxes(eq)
