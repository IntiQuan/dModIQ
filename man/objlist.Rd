\usage{
objlist(value, gradient, hessian)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{numeric of length 1}

\item{gradient}{named numeric}

\item{hessian}{matrix with rownames and colnames according to gradient names}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{objlist}

\description{
An objective list contains an objective value, a gradient, and a Hessian matrix.

Objective lists can contain additional numeric attributes that are preserved or
combined with the corresponding attributes of another objective list when
both are added by the "+" operator, see \link{sumobjlist}.

Objective lists are returned by objective functions as being generated
by \link{normL2}, \link{constraintL2}, \link{priorL2} and \link{datapointL2}.

\examples{
# objlist(1, c(a = 1, b = 2), matrix(2, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, dimnames = list(c("a", "b"),c("a", "b"))))
